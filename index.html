            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>    In a nutshell, Python is an intuitive and easy to understand language that can be used in
                different applications such as Data Science, Machine Learning and AI, Web Development, Softwares,
                Operating System, and many more.</p>
            <p>    And to define Python in technical terms, Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose
                programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of
                significant indentation.</p>
            <p>    First off, Python is "interpreted", meaning, Python doesn't have what we call a compiler which is common
                to languages like C, C++, or Java, which are written closer to machine code. And being an interpreted language
                makes it intuitive enough for humans to easily read the code, even without ever written a single line of it, and
                that makes it a "high-level", a language that's very abstracted away from machine code and focuses on human
                readability. And lastly, Python is General Purpose, which again, is used to create a bunch of other things, like
                Data Science, Web Development, Softwares, Operating Systems, and even in Computer Graphics (blender for example).
                And before we end the intro, note that Python is notorious for it's significant use of whitespace, mostly indents,
                which is highly embeded in its Design Philosophy called "The Zen of Python". (If you have Python installed, try running
                "import this" to access this easter egg in Python).

            <h2>What this expects from you</h2>
            <p>    This documentation is not a tutorial page, and it is expecting you to have some understanding about programming
                and the concepts like loops, functions, and classes.
                Though, this guide isn't too technical and beginners can still understand the guide.</p>

        <section id="Installation" class="main-section">
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>    If you're a Linux or Mac User, Python is already installed into your system by default, but you can change to different
                versions or upgrade what you have by going to their official website at www.python.org</p>
            <p>    If you're using Windows, just go to the official Python page at www.python.org and download the realease that you want.
                Then head over to your Downloads folder and open the Python Installer, and just follow the steps you'll see there.</p>
            <p>    You can check Python if it's installed by opening up the terminal (linux/mac) or cmd (windows) and type python3 --version
                for linux/mac, or python --version for windows users. If you saw something like Python 3.** (Python 3.8.2, Python 3.7.5, etc.),
                then you're good to go.</p>

            <h2>Hello World</h2>
            <p>    Once you have Python into your system, let us try it by running a simple Hello World program.
                First, open your terminal (Linux/Mac) or command prompt/cmd (Windows), and then type python (for windows)
                or python3 for Linux/Mac. There, you can type print("Hello World") and press enter:</p>

        <section id="Data_Types" class="main-section">
            <h2>Data Types</h2>
            <p>Like other languages, Python have it's default or native data types called:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        string
        int
        float
        complex
        boolean
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Strings are those data that are wrapped inside quotation marks:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        "This is a string"                  
        'This is also a string'             
        No quotation mark, not a string     
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>    Integers or int are numeric data types that can be positive, zero, or negative, but have no decimal.
                Note: int data types don't have quotation marks in them.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        16      -> This is an int 
        -5      -> This is an int 
        0       -> This is an int 
        5.84    -> Not an int 
        "13"    -> Not an int 
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>    Floats or float are also numeric data types, which can be positive or negative like int, but have decimal places
                in them.
                Note: float data types don't have quotation marks on them.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        3.14    -> This is a float 
        -12.672 -> This is a float 
        0.34    -> This is a float 
        0       -> Not a float 
        5       -> Not a float 
        "4.6"   -> Not a float 
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>    Complex are just another numeric data, which resembles mathematical complex numbers.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        (4+0j)  -> This is a complex data type
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Boolean data types have only two values:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        True
        False
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>    Booleans are case sensitive and can only be written this way.
                Note: Booleans don't have quotation marks in them.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        true    -> Not a boolean 
        false   -> Not a boolean 
        "True"  -> Not a boolean 
        "False" -> Not a boolean 
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>If you want to check the data type in Python, you can do this:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        type("Hello World")
        print(type(23))
                </code>
            </pre>
        </section>
        <section id="Variable" class="main-section">
            <h2>Variable</h2>
            <p>Variables are used to store data. You can assign a value to a name, and that name will contain the data passed on to it.</p>
            <pre>

        >>> name = "Menard"
        >>> print(name)
        Menard
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>You can also use variables to perform some operations like this:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> num1 = 5
        >>> num2 = 7
        >>> print(num1 + num2)
        12
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Variables can also store values this way:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> num1 = 3
        >>> num2 = 6
        >>> num3 = num1 + num2
        >>> print(num3)
        9
                </code>
            </pre>
        </section>
        <section id="Comments" class="main-section">
            <h2>Comments</h2>
            <p>    Comments are common to all programming languages as it gives a way to communicate between programmers
                especially about a certain code, on what it does, how it works, what it needs, or sometimes, used as a template
                to outline a program.
                Note that comments were ignored by the language when it runs the code.
                In Python, you can create a comment using the # symbol:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> # this is a comment, and it won't run
        >>>
        >>> # Below prints Hello World
        >>> print('Hello World')
        Hello World
        >>>
        >>> # This will not run
        >>> # print('hello world')
        >>>
                </code>
            </pre>
        </section>
        <section id="Data_Structures" class="main-section">
            <h2>Data Structures</h2>
            <p>
                Though variables can be used to store data, the problem is that you can only store one data in them.
                And here comes the Data Structures to save the day. With data structures, you can store a bunch of data in them,
                and they can also be passed to variables.
                In Python, we have 4 built-in Data Structures:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        list    # other languages refer to this as an array
        tuple
        set
        dict    # Or Dictionary, which is hash map in other languages
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Python lists can store any number of data or none at all, where the data type could be anything. Lists can store
                strings, ints, floats, complex, and booleans. Lists are constructed using [   ]
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> [1, 3.14, "Hello", True, (4+0j)]
        >>> nums = [1, 3, 4.15, -8]
        >>> my_data = ['menard', 20, True]
        >>> fruits = ['apple', 'mango', 'banana', 'orange']
        >>> print(fruits)
        ['apple', 'mango', 'banana', 'orange']
        >>> type(fruits)
        &lt;class 'list'&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                You can access data from a list using index. An index is the position of a data inside an array (index starts at 0)
                To access a data within an array, you specify the array followed by [   ] with index inside:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> my_data = ['menard', 20, True]
        >>> print(my_data[0])
        menard
        >>> print(my_data[2])
        True
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                You can also change a data inside an array by using it's index:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> my_data = ['menard', 20, True]
        >>> my_data[0] = 'nad'
        >>> print(my_data)
        ['nad', 20, True]
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Python tuples are like lists and are constructed using ().</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> (1, -5, 3.15, True)
        >>> coordinates = (23, 5)
        >>> print(coordinates[0])
        23
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>The only difference of tuples with arrays is that you can't change the value inside a tuple:</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> a = (1, 2, 3)
        >>> a[0] = 6
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
        TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
        >>> print(a)
        (1, 2, 3)
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Another Python data structure is the Set, which is also like lists and can be constructed using {}</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> {'Apple', 45, -3, 3.14, True}
        >>> animals = {'dogs', 'cats', 'birds', 'snakes', 'lizards'}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                The difference is that python sets acts similarly as sets in Math, where items are unique and sorted.
                You can also perform set operations just like in Math
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> numbers = {4, 2, 7, 4, 3, 9}
        >>> print(numbers)
        {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                And lastly, we have dictionaries, which are also constructed using {}, and the most unique of all these
                data structures. Dictionaries are constructed using key-value pairs and accessed using keys:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> my_data = {'name': 'Menard', 'age': 20, 'is_student': True}
        >>> print(my_data[name])
        Menard
                </code>
            </pre>

        </section>
        <section id="if_elif_else" class="main-section">
            <h2>if elif else</h2>
            <p>
                Conditionals are of great importance in programming languages to give them logic and decision making.
                Conditionals check a certain condition passed to it and decides which one to execute:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> weather = 'Sunny'
        >>> if weather == 'Rainy':
        ...     print('Bring an umbrella')
        ... elif weather == 'Sunny':
        ...     print('Wear sun glasses')
        ... else:
        ...     print('Take care!')
        ...
        Wear sun glasses    
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                The if statement checks if the statement given to it is True, and if it is, it will execute the code inside it.
                If not, it will continue to next conditional (if any) and check if it is True, and in this case, using the elif
                statement. If all conditions resulted to false, the else statement (if specified) will be automatically executed.

                    ...
                    0
                    1

                The loop above printed the num 5 times while the condition (num &lt; 5) is true. And the moment num reaches 5,
                the loop breaks, which is achieved by incrementing the count.
                Note: If the loop does not break, the while loop will never stop.

            <h2>for loop</h2>
            <p>The for loop is like while loop, but the difference is that it iterates onto something to create a loop.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> name = 'Menard'
        >>> for letter in name:
        ...     print(letter)
        ...
        M
        e
        n

            Since a string is an iterable, the for loop iterate through each character of the string name and executed
            the print(letter) 6 times.
        </p>
        <p>If you don't have an iterable, you can use range() function with for loop:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
        >>> for num in range(10):
        ...     print(num)
        ...
        0
        1
        2
        3
        4
        5
        6
        7
        8
        9
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Note that the range uses index notation, and it starts from 0 and gave 10 numbers (0-9 are 10 numbers in total)</p>

            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>
                Functions are a way for us to abstract a code and can be used many times by calling them.
                In Python, you can create a function like this:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> def say_hi():
        ...     print('Hi there!')
        ...
        >>> say_hi()
        Hi there!
        >>> say_hi()
        Hi there!
        >>>
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Notice that the print statement didn't execute right away. That's because it's inside a function, and you can only
                activate the code inside it by calling its name.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also pass an argument or input in a function, and python functions also accept keyword argument:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> def greet(name, message="Hi"):
        ...     print(message + ' ' + name + '!')
        ...
        >>> greet('Menard')
        Hi Menard!
        >>> greet('nard', message="hello")
        hello nard!
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                To get an output from a function, you can use the return keyword.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> def add_nums(num1, num2):
        ...     return num1 + num2
        ...
        >>> my_num = add_nums(4, 5)
        >>> print(my_nums)
        9
                </code>

                Since Python is a multi-paradign language (it supports many design methods), you can also do Object Oriented Programming
                in Python and you can create a class like this:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> class Dog:
        ...     def bark(self):
        ...         return 'rooof!'
        ...     def play_trick(self):
        ...         return 'does a fetch'
        ...        
        >>> my_pet = Dog()
        >>> my_pet.bark()
        rooof!
        >>> my_pet.play_trick()
        does a fetch
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                The self here is just a common convention in Python to refer it as a common method of a Python class.
            </p>


            <p>
                To create a custom constructor in Python, you can overwrite the __init__ method:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        >>> class Person:
        ...     def __init__(self, name, age):
        ...         self.name = name
        ...         self.age = age
        ...     def greet(self):
        ...         return f'Hi! My name is {self.name}'
        ...     def say_age(self):
        ...         return f'I am {self.age} yrs. old'
        ...     def answer_addition(self, num1, num2):
        ...         return f'It is {num1 + num2}'
        ...
        >>> friend = Person('Menard', 20)
        >>> friend.name
        Menard
        >>> friend.age
        20
        >>> friend.greet()
        Hi! My name is Menard'
        >>> friend.say_age()
        I am 20 yrs. old
        >>> friend.answer_addition(4, 6)
        It is 10
                </code>
